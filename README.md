## The Climber Role

The Goal:
Make it to the top!

Abilities:
One random Climber will recieve the reusable Blowgun!

## The Hunter Role

The Goal:
Stop the Climbers from reaching the top at all costs!

Abilities:
The Reach Ability is now an explosive Attack which causes a knockback and damage to anyone within this area of effect! Be careful though as it costs 50% of your stamina!
You will also naturally regen extra stamina to be able to catch up with the Climbers!

## Game Setup

In the passport, you can change which role you are: Hunter or Climber.
You should see a corresponding amount of Knives and Climbers in the Boarding Pass as there are in the Lobby!
You can also see which team you're on based on the icon above the Stamina Bar.

The host of the game can set specific paramters in the settings, in the Hunter Tab.
These settings are the same as the ones in the Mod Config.

For added spice, you can set the game to start with 1 Random Hunter by enabling "Pick Random Hunter"!
You can also enable "Zombie Mode" where once a Climber dies, they join the Hunter Team!
